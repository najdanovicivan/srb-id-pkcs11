# PKCS11 module for Serbian ID

This is open source [PKCS11 v2.40](https://docs.oasis-open.org/pkcs11/pkcs11-base/v2.40/pkcs11-base-v2.40.html) module for Serbian ID smart cards. It is designed for smart cards produced by Gemalto and aims to support the functionality required for authenticating and signing into official state portals (like [eUprava](https://euprava.gov.rs/) or [ePorezi](https://eporezi.purs.gov.rs/user/login.html)).

## Status

Ð¢he module is currently in an early development phase. Digest functions are implemented (except RIPEMD160), session and token management functions are generally implemented. Signing and verification are next goals.

Functions intended for security officers (`CKU_SO`) are not planned for implementation at this stage. They are not required for end users, and omitting them reduces the code complexity.

## Compilation

First, download PKCS11 headers:

```bash
OASIS_URL="https://docs.oasis-open.org/pkcs11/pkcs11-base/v2.40/errata01/os/include/pkcs11-v2.40"
curl --output include/pkcs11.h $(OASIS_URL)/pkcs11.h
curl --output include/pkcs11f.h $(OASIS_URL)/pkcs11f.h
curl --output include/pkcs11t.h $(OASIS_URL)/pkcs11t.h
```

Then, build the project with:

```
zig build
```

You will maybe need to configure [PCSC lite](https://pcsclite.apdu.fr/) path in `build.zig`.
